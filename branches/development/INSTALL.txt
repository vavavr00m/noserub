This is the installation instruction for NoseRub in PHP.


UPDATE
======
If you update from a previous release, jump directly to step 4 of the
installation process.


INSTALL
=======

0. What do I need?
------------------
You need MySQL and PHP 5. MySQL 5 is strongly advised. PHP 5 must have 
enabled either the GMP extension or the Bcmath extension plus the GD and curl
extensions. Also make sure that the value for "memory_limit" in your php.ini is
higher than 8MB. 

Your webserver (I assume Apache, never tried something else) should 
have mod_rewrite installed and made available for the directory, NoseRub is
installed at. This is important, so that the URLs are the same on all
servers in the NoseRub "universe".



1. Download NoseRub
-------------------
You obviously already did that, because this file is included in the package...
If due strange circumstances you need to know where to download NoseRub for 
PHP, please look here:
    http://noserub.com/code/



2. Install NoseRub on your webserver
------------------------------------
Therefore you should just extract the archive to the document root of your
webserver:
    tar -zxf noserub_<version>.tar.gz

Make sure that /noserub/app/tmp and /noserub/app/webroot/static/avatars are 
writeable by the webserver. If you don't want to have your NoseRub installation 
under http://<server_name>/noserub/, but rather directly under http://<server_name>/, 
just point the document root of the webserver to /noserub/app/webroot/.



3. Create database.php and noserub.php
--------------------------------------
You find 
    database.php.default 
and 
    noserub.php.default 

under noserub/app/config/. You should use both default files as a template 
for you own settings:
  cd noserub/app/config
  cp noserub.php.default noserub.php
  cp database.php.default database.php

In database.php, please enter information to contact your database server. You
should create a new database for NoseRub, as there are no prefixes available
for the table names and you don't want to overwrite existing tables.

In noserub.php, make sure you enter a value for 
	NOSERUB_ADMIN_HASH
	


4. Call the update url
----------------------
You should now be able to call the following url:
    http://<server_name>/noserub/jobs/<NOSERUB_ADMIN_HASH>/system/update
or
    http://<server_name>/jobs/<NOSERUB_ADMIN_HASH>/system/update
depending on how you set it up in step #2.

If neccessary, this page will show your settings you need to make, or it will
display database updates. Even when installing noserub for the first time, it
is normal to see database updates.

If you get a OK for Settings and the Database, you now can call
    http://<server_name>/noserub/
or
    http://<server_name>/
depending on how you set it up in step #2.



5. Set up cron job
------------------
If you set the value for Noserub.manual_feeds_update in noserub.php to "true", 
you have to run the following command via cron to update the feed cache:

    php noserub/app/webroot/shell_dispatcher.php /cache/feed/refresh/
