This is the installation instruction for NoseRub in PHP.


UPDATE
======
If you update from a previous release, jump directly to step 4 of the
installation process.


INSTALL
=======

0. What do I need?
------------------
You need MySQL and PHP, both preferable with a version of 5 or higher. Your
webserver (I assume Apache, never tried something else) should have
mod_rewrite installed and made available for the directory, NoseRub is
installed at. This is important, so that the URLs are the same on all
servers in the NoseRub "universe".



1. Download NoseRub
-------------------
You obviously already did that, because this file is included in the package...
If due strange circumstances you need to know where to download NoseRub for 
PHP, please look here:
    http://noserub.com/code/



2. Install NoseRub on your webserver
------------------------------------
Therefore you should just extract the archive to the document root of your
webserver:
    tar -zxf noserub_0.1a.tar.gz

Make sure that /noserub/app/tmp is writeable by the webserver.



3. Create database.php and noserub.php
--------------------------------------
You find 
    database.php.default 
and 
    noserub.php.default 

under noserub/app/config/. You should use both default files as a template 
for you own settings:
  cd noserub/app/config
  cp noserub.php.default noserub.php
  cp database.php.default database.php

In database.php, please enter information to contact your database server. You
should create a new database for NoseRub, as there are no prefixes available
for the table names and you don't want to overwrite existing tables.

In noserub.php, make sure you enter values to the two constants 
    NOSERUB_DOMAIN
and
	NOSERUB_ADMIN_HASH
	


4. Call the update url
----------------------
You should now be able to call the following url:
    http://<NOSERUB_DOMAIN>/noserub/jobs/<NOSERUB_ADMIN_HASH>/system/update

If neccessary, this page will show you settings you need to make, or it will
display database updates. Even when installing noserub for the first time, it
is normal to see database updates.

If you get a OK for Settings and the Database, you now can call
  http://<NOSERUB_DOMAIN>/noserub/
