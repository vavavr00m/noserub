NoseRub itself is a protocol for decentralized social networks. In this code repository, we will hold a sample application in PHP, that implement NoseRub.

We're using [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org) as framework for this project.

I just created a new branch, which fixes a few issues from the version that I presentet at Barcamp Cologne 2: [fixedbarcamp](http://noserub.googlecode.com/svn/branches/fixedbarcamp/)

Instead of using Subversion to access the source, you can also download the [archive](http://noserub.googlecode.com/files/noserub-0.4.tar.gz).
